# Database deadlock caused by concurrent customer register

## 1. Overview

We firstly introduce the environment:

- Broadleaf code: Broadleafcommerce ([broadleaf-6.0.9-GA](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/tree/broadleaf-6.0.9-GA)) + Demosite ([broadleaf-6.0.9-GA](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/DemoSite/tree/broadleaf-6.0.9-GA))
- Database: MySQL 5.7.25 with **serializable** isolation level(other MySQL versions should also produce the deadlock, but we did not check)

When 2 users register simultaneously, 2 threads executing  [CustomerServiceImpl.registerCustomer](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-profile/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/profile/core/service/CustomerServiceImpl.java#L148) may cause deadlock on table BLC_CUSTOMER. 

## 2. Detail Bug Reasons

This deadlock is caused when 2 threads simultaneously execute the  [CustomerServiceImpl.registerCustomer](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-profile/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/profile/core/service/CustomerServiceImpl.java#L148), which is a transaction responsible for user registration. This transaction contains 2 SQL statements as follows:

```sql
A: SELECT ... FROM BLC_CUSTOMER WHERE CUSTOMER_ID = xxx
B: INSERT INTO BLC_CUSTOMER (..., CUSTOMER_ID) values (..., xxx)
```

(we ignore the fields in table BLC_CUSTOMER other than CUSTOMER_ID for other fields have nothing to do with this deadlock)

when 2 threads simultaneously execute the transaction, we consider the following execution order: 1-A, 2-A, 1-B, 2-B

```sql
1-A: SELECT ... FROM BLC_CUSTOMER WHERE CUSTOMER_ID = 1
2-A: SELECT ... FROM BLC_CUSTOMER WHERE CUSTOMER_ID = 2
1-B: INSERT INTO BLC_CUSTOMER (..., CUSTOMER_ID) values (..., 1)
2-B: INSERT INTO BLC_CUSTOMER (..., CUSTOMER_ID) values (..., 1)
```

The *thread-1* want to register a new customer with `CUSTOMER_ID=1`, and *thread-2* want to register a new customer with `CUSTOMER_ID=2`. 

First, *thread-1* issues `SELECT` to get the customer with `CUSTOMER_ID=1` and it acquire a **gap lock** for the customer with id=1 doesn't exist.  This gap lock will block `thread-2` to insert the customer into table `BLC_CUSTOMER`. 

Then, *thread-2* issues `SELECT` to get the customer with `CUSTOMER_ID=2` and it also acquire a **gap lock** for the customer with id=2 doesn't exist. This gap lock will block `thread-1` to insert the customer into table `BLC_CUSTOMER`. 

Then, *thread-1* issues `INSERT` to insert a new customer with  `CUSTOMER_ID=1` but is blocked by gap lock held by *thread-2*.

Then, thread-2 issues `INSERT` to insert a new customer with  `CUSTOMER_ID=2` but is blocked by gap lock held by *thread-1*.

Finally, *thread-1* and *thread-2* block each other and a deadlock occurs.



## 3. Possible Solution

[CustomerServiceImpl.registerCustomer](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-profile/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/profile/core/service/CustomerServiceImpl.java#L148) throws database deadlock exception when user registers. We noticed that this deadlock is really caused when executing [customerDao.save](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-profile/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/profile/core/service/CustomerServiceImpl.java#L131), which use [em.merge](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-profile/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/profile/core/dao/CustomerDaoImpl.java#L137) to insert the new customer to table `BLC_CUSTOMER`.

`em.merge` firstly issues `SELECT` to get the customer with target customer id. If the customer exist, it then issue `UPDATE` to modify the target customer. If the customer doesn't exist, it issues `INSERT` to insert a new customer. Actually in our user registration scenario,  the customer must not exist in database before registration, so the `SELECT` statement issued by `em.merge` is redundant.

According to our understanding, the `SELECT` statement issued by `em.merge` is redundant, as the parameter `CUSTOMER_ID` is different for each invocation of [CustomerServiceImpl.registerCustomer](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-profile/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/profile/core/service/CustomerServiceImpl.java#L148). Therefore, we propose to replace the `em.merge` with `em.persist`. `em.persist` will only issue `INSERT` to insert a new customer. 

All In all, we use `em.persist` to replace the `em.merge` when executing  [customerDao.save](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-profile/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/profile/core/service/CustomerServiceImpl.java#L131), which eliminates redundant `SELECT`  statement in transaction  [CustomerServiceImpl.registerCustomer](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-profile/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/profile/core/service/CustomerServiceImpl.java#L148), therefore avoid the deadlock.
