# Database deadlock caused by add items to shopping cart (1)

## 1. Overview

We firstly introduce the environment:

- Broadleaf code: Broadleafcommerce ([broadleaf-6.0.9-GA](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/tree/broadleaf-6.0.9-GA)) + Demosite ([broadleaf-6.0.9-GA](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/DemoSite/tree/broadleaf-6.0.9-GA))
- Database: MySQL 5.7.25 with **serializable** isolation level(other MySQL versions should also produce the deadlock, but we did not check)

Deadlock-related transaction:  

- [OrderServiceImpl.addItem](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/order/service/OrderServiceImpl.java#L634) 

Deadlock-related API:

- [addCart](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework-web/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/web/controller/cart/BroadleafCartController.java#L111)

Precondition:

- When execute the [OrderServiceImpl.addItem](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/order/service/OrderServiceImpl.java#L634), there is at lease 1 items in the requesting customer's shopping cart.



## 2. Detailed Bug Reasons

This deadlock is caused when 2 threads simultaneously execute the  [OrderServiceImpl.addItem](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/order/service/OrderServiceImpl.java#L634), which is a transaction responsible for adding new item into cart. This transaction contains 2 SQL statements as follows:

```sql
A: select * from BLC_ORDER_ITEM where order_id=:order_id
B: select ... from BLC_ORDER_ITEM childorder0_ join ... where childorder0_.parent_order_id=:order_id
C: insert into BLC_ORDER_ITEM (order_item_id, order_id, ...) values (:order_item_id, :order_id, ...)
```

(we ignore the fields in table `BLC_ORDER_ITEM` that are unrelated to this deadlock)

The initial state of table `BLC_ORDER_ITEM` is as follows:

| order_item_id | order_id |
| ------------- | -------- |
| 1             | 1        |
| 2             | 2        |
|               |          |

(order_id is indexed by a secondary index of table  `BLC_ORDER_ITEM`)

When 2 threads simultaneously execute the transaction, we consider the following execution order: 1-B, 2-A, 1-C, 2-C

```sql
1-B: select * from BLC_ORDER_ITEM join xxx where parent_order_item_id=1
2-A: select * from BLC_ORDER_ITEM where order_id=2
1-C: insert into BLC_ORDER_ITEM (order_item_id, order_id, ...) values (3, 1, ...)
2-C: insert into BLC_ORDER_ITEM (order_item_id, order_id, ...) values (4, 2, ...)
```

First, *thread-1* issues `SELECT` to find children items of existing order item(id=1), but result of  `SELECT` is empty.  Because parent_order_item_id is indexed by table `BLC_ORDER_ITEM`'s secondary index, the *thread-1* will acquire a gap lock ranging (-∞， +∞)  on index `parent_order_item_id`. This gap lock will block *thread-2* to insert new order item into table `BLC_ORDER_ITEM` 

Then, *thread-2* issue `SELECT` to find all order items in order(order_id=2). Because the order_id is indexed by table  `BLC_ORDER_ITEM`'s secondary index, so it will acquire the gap lock ranging (1, 2), which will block *thread-1*  to insert the order_item(order_id=1).

Then, *thread-1* issues `INSERT` to insert a new order item with  `orde_id=1` but is blocked by gap lock held by *thread-2*. 

Then, *thread-2* issues `INSERT` to insert a new order item with  `orde_id=2` but is blocked by gap lock held by *thread-1*. 

Finally, *thread-1* and *thread-2* block each other and a deadlock occurs.



## 3. Possible Solution

In order to avoid this deadlock, we propose to move the `select * from BLC_ORDER_ITEM where order_id=:order_id` out of this transaction by adding one invocation of `findMatchingItem` ahead of the transaction [OrderServiceImpl.addItem](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/order/service/OrderServiceImpl.java#L634). In this way, the `select * from BLC_ORDER_ITEM where order_id=:order_id` will not be issued again by `findMatchingItem` in transaction [OrderServiceImpl.addItem](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/order/service/OrderServiceImpl.java#L634). It is because ORM caches the read results during first `findMatchingItem` invocation for further reads.

When this deadlock fixed, we modify the broadleaf code as follows:

- [BroadleafCartController.java](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework-web/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/web/controller/cart/BroadleafCartController.java#L111)

  ```java
  // begin line:111
  public String add(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Model model, OrderItemRequestDTO itemRequest) throws IOException, AddToCartException,   PricingException, NumberFormatException, RemoveFromCartException, IllegalArgumentException  {
      //...
      // line:134
      itemRequest.setOverrideRetailPrice(null);
      itemRequest.setOverrideSalePrice(null);
      OrderItem item = orderService.findMatchingItem(cart, itemRequest);
      
      cart = orderService.addItem(cart.getId(), itemRequest, false); // line:136
  	  //...
      return isAjaxRequest(request) ? getCartView() : getCartPageRedirect(); // line:139
  }
  ```


We think the deadlock fixing approach is correct because when executing [addCart](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework-web/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/web/controller/cart/BroadleafCartController.java#L111), the thread must hold the [OrderLock](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/655c3afeeb12f927a636eb43021cddee3d05133a/core/broadleaf-framework-web/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/web/order/security/CartStateFilter.java#L104) of this order. No other thread can concurrently modify the order or other rows with (direct or indirect) foreign key relationship to order, so whether the  `select * from BLC_ORDER_ITEM where order_id=:order_id` statement is executed in or out of the transaction  [OrderServiceImpl.addItem](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/order/service/OrderServiceImpl.java#L634), we will get the same result (same order items).
