# Database deadlock caused by saving customer addresses

## 1. Overview

We firstly introduce the environment:

- Broadleaf code: Broadleafcommerce ([broadleaf-6.0.9-GA](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/tree/broadleaf-6.0.9-GA)) + Demosite ([broadleaf-6.0.9-GA](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/DemoSite/tree/broadleaf-6.0.9-GA))
- Database: MySQL 5.7.25 with **serializable** isolation level(other MySQL versions should also produce the deadlock, but we did not check)

Deadlock-related transaction:  

- [CustomerAddressServiceImpl.saveCustomerAddress](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-profile/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/profile/core/service/CustomerAddressServiceImpl.java#L40)

Deadlock-related API:

- [singleShip](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework-web/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/web/controller/checkout/BroadleafShippingInfoController.java#L108) 



## 2. Detailed Bug Reasons 

This deadlock is caused when 2 threads simultaneously execute the [CustomerAddressServiceImpl.saveCustomerAddress](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-profile/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/profile/core/service/CustomerAddressServiceImpl.java#L40),  which is a transaction responsible for creating the customer address. This transaction contains 2 SQL statements as follows:

```sql
A: select * from BLC_CUSTOMER_ADDRESS where customer_id = ?
B: insert into BLC_CUSTOMER_ADDRESS (customer_address_id, customer_id, ...) values (?, ?, ...)
```

(customer_id is the secondary key of table BLC_CUSTOMER_ADDRESS)

The initial state of table `BLC_CUSTOMER_ADDRESS` is as follows:

| customer_address_id | customer_id |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| 1                   | 1           |
|                     |             |

when 2 threads simultaneously execute the transaction, we consider the following execution order: 1-A, 2-A, 1-B, 2-B

```sql
1-A: select * from BLC_CUSTOMER_ADDRESS where customer_id = 2
2-A: select * from BLC_CUSTOMER_ADDRESS where customer_id = 3
1-B: insert into BLC_CUSTOMER_ADDRESS (customer_address_id, customer_id, ...) values (2, 2, ...)
2-B: insert into BLC_CUSTOMER_ADDRESS (customer_address_id, customer_id, ...) values (3, 3, ...)
```

First, *thread-1* issues `SELECT` to find delivery address of target customer(customer_id=2), but result of  `SELECT` is empty.  Because `customer_id`  is indexed by table `BLC_CUSTOMER_ADDRESS`'s secondary index, the *thread-1* will acquire a gap lock ranging (1, +∞)  on index `customer_id`. This gap lock will block *thread-2* to insert new address into table `BLC_CUSTOMER_ADDRESS`.

First, *thread-2* issues `SELECT` to find delivery address of target customer(customer_id=3), but result of  `SELECT` is empty.  Because `customer_id`  is indexed by table `BLC_CUSTOMER_ADDRESS`'s secondary index, the *thread-2* will acquire a gap lock ranging (1, +∞)  on index `customer_id`. This gap lock will block *thread-1* to insert new address into table `BLC_CUSTOMER_ADDRESS`.

Then, *thread-1* issues `INSERT` to insert a new address with  `customer_id=2` but is blocked by gap lock held by *thread-2*.

Then, *thread-1* issues `INSERT` to insert a new address with  `customer_id=3` but is blocked by gap lock held by *thread-2*.

Finally, *thread-1* and *thread-2* block each other and a deadlock occurs.



## 3. Possible Solution

In order to avoid this deadlock, we propose to reorder the `SELECT` and `INSERT` statements in transaction [CustomerAddressServiceImpl.saveCustomerAddress](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-profile/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/profile/core/service/CustomerAddressServiceImpl.java#L40), which does 2 things.

  1.  Check if it is needed to set the new address as the default address.

      `SELECT` statement is issued when do this.

  2.  Write the address into database.

      `INSERT` statement is issued when do this.

The original code first check if it is needed to set the new address as the default address and then write the address into database. Therefore, the `SELECT` is issued before `INSERT`. But we can also write the address into database first, and then check if it is needed to set the new address to be the default address. In this way, `INSERT` is issued before `SELECT`, so the gap lock acquired by`SELECT` will not block `INSERT` and the deadlock is fixed.

When this deadlock fixed, we modify the Broadleaf code as follows:

- [CustomerAddressServiceImpl.java](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-profile/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/profile/core/service/CustomerAddressServiceImpl.java#L40)

  ```java
  public CustomerAddress saveCustomerAddress(CustomerAddress customerAddress) {
      Customer customer = customerAddress.getCustomer();
      customerAddress = customerAddressDao.save(customerAddress);
  
      List<CustomerAddress> activeCustomerAddresses = readActiveCustomerAddressesByCustomerId(customer.getId());
      if (activeCustomerAddresses.size() == 1 && activeCustomerAddresses.contains(customerAddress)){
          customerAddress.getAddress().setDefault(true);
      }
  
      customerAddress = customerAddressDao.save(customerAddress);
  
      // if parameter address is set as default, unset all other default addresses
      if (customerAddress.getAddress().isDefault()) {
          customerAddressDao.makeCustomerAddressDefault(customerAddress.getId(), customer.getId());
      }
  
      return customerAddress;
  }
  ```
