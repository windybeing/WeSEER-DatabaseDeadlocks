# Database deadlock caused by pricing the order (6)

## 1. Overview

We firstly introduce the environment:

- Broadleaf code: Broadleafcommerce ([broadleaf-6.0.9-GA](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/tree/broadleaf-6.0.9-GA)) + Demosite ([broadleaf-6.0.9-GA](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/DemoSite/tree/broadleaf-6.0.9-GA))
- Database: MySQL 5.7.25 with **serializable** isolation level(other MySQL versions should also produce the deadlock, but we did not check)

Deadlock-related transaction:  

- [PricingService.executePricing](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/pricing/service/PricingServiceImpl.java#L37)

Deadlock-related API:

- [singleShip](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework-web/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/web/controller/checkout/BroadleafShippingInfoController.java#L108) 

## 2. Detailed Bug Reasons 

This deadlock is caused when 2 threads simultaneously execute the [PricingService.executePricing](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/pricing/service/PricingServiceImpl.java#L37), which is a transaction responsible for pricing the order. This transaction contains 2 SQL statements as follows:

```sql
A: select ... from BLC_FG_ADJUSTMENT fulfillmen0_ join xxx where fulfillmen0_.fulfillment_group_id=?
B: select * from BLC_FG_ITEM_TAX_XREF where fulfillment_group_item_id = ?
C: insert into BLC_FG_ADJUSTMENT (fulfillment_group_id, fg_adjustment_id, ...) values (?, ?, ...)
D: insert into BLC_FG_ITEM_TAX_XREF (tax_detail_id, fulfillment_group_item_id, ...) values (?, ?, ...)
```

(fulfillment_group_id is the secondary key of table BLC_FG_ADJUSTMENT, fulfillment_group_item_id is the secondary key of table BLC_FG_ITEM_TAX_XREF)

The initial state of table `BLC_FG_ADJUSTMENT` is as follows:

| fg_adjustment_id | fulfillment_group_id |
| ---------------- | -------------------- |
| 1                | 1                    |
|                  |                      |

The initial state of table `BLC_FG_ITEM_TAX_XREF` is as follows:

| tax_detail_id | fulfillment_group_item_id |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1             | 1                         |
|               |                           |

when 2 threads simultaneously execute the transaction, we consider the following execution order: 1-A, 2-B, 1-C, 2-D

```sql
1-A: select ... from BLC_FG_ADJUSTMENT fulfillmen0_ join xxx where fulfillmen0_.fulfillment_group_id=2
2-A: select * from BLC_FG_ITEM_TAX_XREF where fulfillment_group_item_id = 3
1-B: insert into BLC_FG_ADJUSTMENT (fulfillment_group_id, fg_adjustment_id, ...) values (2, 2, ...)
2-B: insert into BLC_FG_ITEM_TAX_XREF (tax_detail_id, fulfillment_group_item_id, ...) values (3, 3, ...)
```

First, *thread-1* issues `SELECT` to find adjustment of target group(fulfillment_group_id=2), but result of  `SELECT` is empty.  Because `fulfillment_group_id`  is indexed by table `BLC_FG_ADJUSTMENT`'s secondary index, the *thread-1* will acquire a gap lock ranging (1， +∞)  on index `fulfillment_group_id`. This gap lock will block *thread-2* to insert new item into table `BLC_FG_ADJUSTMENT`.

Then, *thread-2* issues `SELECT` to find tax detail of target fulfillment group item(fulfillment_group_item_id=3), but result of  `SELECT` is empty.  Because `fulfillment_group_item_id`  is indexed by table `BLC_FG_ITEM_TAX_XREF`'s secondary index, the *thread-1* will acquire a gap lock ranging (1， +∞)  on index `fulfillment_group_item_id`. This gap lock will block *thread-1* to insert new item into table `BLC_FG_ITEM_TAX_XREF`.

Then, *thread-1* issues `INSERT` to insert a new item with  `fulfillment_group_id=2` but is blocked by gap lock held by *thread-2*.

Then, *thread-2* issues `INSERT` to insert a new item with  `fulfillment_group_item_id=3` but is blocked by gap lock held by *thread-1*.

Finally, *thread-1* and *thread-2* block each other and a deadlock occurs.



## 3. Possible Solution

In order to avoid this deadlock, we propose to move the `select ... from BLC_FG_ADJUSTMENT fulfillmen0_ join xxx where fulfillmen0_.fulfillment_group_id=?` out of this transaction by issuing it ahead of the transaction [PricingService.executePricing](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/pricing/service/PricingServiceImpl.java#L37). In this way, the `select ... from BLC_FG_ADJUSTMENT fulfillmen0_ join xxx where fulfillmen0_.fulfillment_group_id=?` will not be issued again. It is because ORM caches the read results for further reads.

When this deadlock fixed, we modify the Broadleaf code as follows:

- `OrderServiceImpl.java`

  ```java
  @Override // line:312
  public Order save(Order order, Boolean priceOrder) throws PricingException {
      //...
      if (priceOrder) { //line:326
      	//...
          // line:338
          order.getFulfillmentGroups().stream(). // added code
                                  flatMap(fg -> fg.getFulfillmentGroupAdjustments().stream()).count(); // added code
      }
      
      //...
  }
  ```

We think the deadlock fixing approach is correct because when executing [singleShip](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework-web/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/web/controller/checkout/BroadleafShippingInfoController.java#L108), the thread must hold the [OrderLock](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/655c3afeeb12f927a636eb43021cddee3d05133a/core/broadleaf-framework-web/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/web/order/security/CartStateFilter.java#L104) of this order. No other thread can concurrently modify the order or other rows with (direct or indirect) foreign key relationship to order, so whether the  `select ... from BLC_FG_ADJUSTMENT fulfillmen0_ join xxx where fulfillmen0_.fulfillment_group_id=?` statement is executed in or out of the transaction [PricingService.executePricing](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/pricing/service/PricingServiceImpl.java#L37), we will get the same result.
