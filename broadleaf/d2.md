# Database deadlock caused by order related locks


## 1. Overview

We firstly introduce the environment:

- Broadleaf code: Broadleafcommerce ([broadleaf-6.0.9-GA](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/tree/broadleaf-6.0.9-GA)) + Demosite ([broadleaf-6.0.9-GA](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/DemoSite/tree/broadleaf-6.0.9-GA))
- Database: MySQL 5.7.25 with **serializable** isolation level(other MySQL versions should also produce the deadlock, but we did not check)

When a customer adds an item to the cart, [OrderServiceImpl.acquireLock](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/order/service/OrderServiceImpl.java#L1057) is executed to acquire the order lock of the cart. But if it is the first time for customer to add an item to the cart, the order lock doesn't exist, so it will first insert a new order lock into table BLC_ORDER_LOCK when executing   [OrderServiceImpl.acquireLock](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/order/service/OrderServiceImpl.java#L1057). But When 2 customers first add an item to the cart at the same time, there will be 2 threads executing [OrderServiceImpl.acquireLock](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/order/service/OrderServiceImpl.java#L1057), which may cause deadlock on table BLC_ORDER_LOCK. 



## 2. Detail Bug Reasons

This deadlock is caused when 2 threads simultaneously execute the  [OrderServiceImpl.acquireLock](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/order/service/OrderServiceImpl.java#L1057) but their order locks still are not created.  [OrderServiceImpl.acquireLock](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/order/service/OrderServiceImpl.java#L1057) is a transaction and it will issues the following two SQL statements when the order lock of the target cart is not exist: 

```sql
A: SELECT count(*) FROM BLC_ORDER_LOCK WHERE ORDER_ID=xxx and LOCK_KEY=xxx
B: INSERT INTO BLC_ORDER_LOCK (LOCKED, LOCK_KEY, ORDER_ID) VALUES('Y', xxx, xxx)
```

(xxx can be arbitrary value here)

When 2 threads simultaneously execute the transaction, we consider the following execution order: 1-A, 2-A, 1-B, 2-B

```sql
1-A: SELECT count(*) FROM BLC_ORDER_LOCK WHERE ORDER_ID=1 and LOCK_KEY='key1'
2-A: SELECT count(*) FROM BLC_ORDER_LOCK WHERE ORDER_ID=2 and LOCK_KEY='key2'
1-B: INSERT INTO BLC_ORDER_LOCK (LOCKED, LOCK_KEY, ORDER_ID) VALUES('Y', 'key1', 1)
2-B: INSERT INTO BLC_ORDER_LOCK (LOCKED, LOCK_KEY, ORDER_ID) VALUES('Y', 'key2', 2)
```

The *thread-1* want to acquire the order lock  with `ORDER_ID=1`, and *thread-2* want to acquire the order lock with `ORDER_ID=2`. 

First, *thread-1* issues `SELECT` to acquire the order lock with `ORDER_ID=1` and it acquires a **gap lock** for the order lock with id=1 doesn't exist.  This gap lock will block `thread-2` to insert the order lock into table `BLC_ORDER_LOCK`. 

Then, *thread-2* issues `SELECT` to acquire the order lock with `ORDER_ID=2` and it also acquires a **gap lock** the order lock with id=2 doesn't exist. This gap lock will block `thread-1`  to insert the order lock into table `BLC_ORDER_LOCK`. 

Then, *thread-1* issues `INSERT` to insert a new order lock with  `ORDER_ID=1` but is blocked by gap lock held by *thread-2*.

Then, *thread-2* issues `INSERT` to insert a new order lock with  `ORDER_ID=2` but is blocked by gap lock held by *thread-1*.

Finally, *thread-1* and *thread-2* block each other and a deadlock occurs.



## 3. Possible Solution

We dig into the execution logic of transaction [OrderServiceImpl.acquireLock](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/order/service/OrderServiceImpl.java#L1057). The transaction will first issue `SELECT` to check if the order lock exist and the later transaction logic depends on the existence of the target order lock.

When the target order lock does not exist, the following two SQL statements are issued:

```sql
A: SELECT count(*) FROM BLC_ORDER_LOCK WHERE ORDER_ID=xxx and LOCK_KEY=xxx
B: INSERT INTO BLC_ORDER_LOCK (LOCKED, LOCK_KEY, ORDER_ID) VALUES('Y', xxx, xxx)
```

If 2 threads execute the above transaction logic at the same time, it may cause a deadlock.

When the target order lock exists, the following two SQL statements are issued:

```sql
A: SELECT count(*) FROM BLC_ORDER_LOCK WHERE ORDER_ID=xxx and LOCK_KEY=xxx
B: UPDATE BLC_ORDER_LOCK SET LOCKED='Y' WHERE ORDER_ID=xxx
```

In order to avoid deadlock and ensure the correctness of the app logic at the same time, we can leverage the **MySQL `UPSERT`** to rewrite the transaction [OrderServiceImpl.acquireLock ](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/order/service/OrderServiceImpl.java#L1057). After rewritten, the transaction logic is as follows:

```java
public boolean acquireLock(Order order) {
    // TODO: try with NativeQuery. If works, maybe change it into NamedQuery.
    String orderLockKey = getOrderLockKey();
    Query upsertQuery = em.createNativeQuery("" +
                                             "insert into BLC_ORDER_LOCK (LOCK_KEY, ORDER_ID, LAST_UPDATED, LOCKED) values (:lockKey, :orderId, :lastUpdated, 'Y')" +
                                             "on duplicate key update " +
                                             "LOCKED = 'Y', " +
                                             "LAST_UPDATED = case when (LOCKED='N' or LAST_UPDATED<-1) then :lastUpdated else LAST_UPDATED end");
    long lastUpdated = System.currentTimeMillis();
    upsertQuery.setParameter("orderId", order.getId());
    upsertQuery.setParameter("lastUpdated", lastUpdated);
    upsertQuery.setParameter("lockKey", orderLockKey);
    upsertQuery.setHint(QueryHints.HINT_CACHEABLE, false);
    int rowsAffected;
    try {
        rowsAffected = upsertQuery.executeUpdate();
        if (rowsAffected == 0) {
            return false;
        } else if (rowsAffected == 1) {
            return true;
        } else if (rowsAffected == 2) {
            return true;
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new RuntimeException("should not go here");
    }
    return false;
}
```

With `UPSERT`, we decrease number the SQL statements from 2 to 1 and this will avoid the deadlock we described above.
