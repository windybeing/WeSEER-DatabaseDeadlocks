# Database deadlock caused by add items to shopping cart (4)
## 1. Overview

We firstly introduce the environment:

- Broadleaf code: Broadleafcommerce ([broadleaf-6.0.9-GA](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/tree/broadleaf-6.0.9-GA)) + Demosite ([broadleaf-6.0.9-GA](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/DemoSite/tree/broadleaf-6.0.9-GA))
- Database: MySQL 5.7.25 with **serializable** isolation level(other MySQL versions should also produce the deadlock, but we did not check)

Deadlock-related transaction:  

- [OrderServiceImpl.addItem](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/order/service/OrderServiceImpl.java#L634) 

Deadlock-related API:

- [addCart](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework-web/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/web/controller/cart/BroadleafCartController.java#L111)

Precondition:

- When execute the [OrderServiceImpl.addItem](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/order/service/OrderServiceImpl.java#L634), there is at lease 1 items in the requesting customer's shopping cart.


## 2. Detailed Bug Reasons 

This deadlock is caused when 2 threads simultaneously execute the  [OrderServiceImpl.addItem](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/order/service/OrderServiceImpl.java#L634), which is a transaction responsible for adding new item into cart. This transaction contains 2 SQL statements as follows:

```sql
A: select * from BLC_ORDER_ITEM join xxx where parent_order_item_id=:order_item_id
B: insert into BLC_ORDER_ITEM (parent_item_id, order_item_id, ...) values (null, :order_item_id, ...)
```

(we ignore the fields in table `BLC_ORDER_ITEM` that are unrelated to this deadlock)

- During execution of transaction [OrderServiceImpl.addItem](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/order/service/OrderServiceImpl.java#L634),  the above `SELECT` statement is issued when executing  [orderItem.getChildOrderItems()](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/order/service/workflow/AddWorkflowPriceOrderIfNecessaryActivity.java#L233), which is invoked by the method [updateChildOrderItem](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/order/service/workflow/AddWorkflowPriceOrderIfNecessaryActivity.java#L181).
- The `INSERT` statement is issued when ORM try to commit transaction.

when 2 threads simultaneously execute the transaction, we consider the following execution order: 1-A, 2-A, 1-B, 2-B

```sql
1-A: select * from BLC_ORDER_ITEM join xxx where parent_order_item_id=1
2-A: select * from BLC_ORDER_ITEM join xxx where parent_order_item_id=2
1-B: insert into BLC_ORDER_ITEM (parent_item_id, order_item_id, ...) values (null, 3, ...)
2-B: insert into BLC_ORDER_ITEM (parent_item_id, order_item_id, ...) values (null, 4, ...)
```

The *thread-1* want to add the item(id=3) into the cart-1, which has an item(id=1) at now; The *thread-2* want to add the item(id=4) into the cart-2, which has an item(id=2) at now.

First, *thread-1* issues `SELECT` to find children items of existing order item(id=1), but the result is empty.  Because parent_order_item_id is indexed by table `BLC_ORDER_ITEM`'s secondary index, *thread-1* acquires a gap lock ranging (-∞， +∞)  on index `parent_order_item_id`. This gap lock will block *thread-2* to insert new order item into table `BLC_ORDER_ITEM` 

Then, *thread-2* issues `SELECT` to find children items of existing order item(id=2), but the result is also empty.  Because `parent_order_item_id` is indexed by table `BLC_ORDER_ITEM`'s secondary index, *thread-2* acquires a gap lock ranging (-∞， +∞) on index `parent_order_item_id`. This gap lock will block *thread-1* to insert new order item into table `BLC_ORDER_ITEM` 

Then, *thread-1* issues `INSERT` to insert a new customer with  `order_item_id=3` but is blocked by gap lock held by *thread-2*.

Then, *thread-1* issues `INSERT` to insert a new customer with  `order_item_id=4` but is blocked by gap lock held by *thread-1*.

Finally, *thread-1* and *thread-2* block each other and a deadlock occurs.

## 3. Possible Solution

During the execution [OrderServiceImpl.addItem](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/order/service/OrderServiceImpl.java#L634), the newly inserted order item is added to ORM cache (but not flush to database) before invoking [updateChildOrderItem](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/order/service/workflow/AddWorkflowPriceOrderIfNecessaryActivity.java#L181), which issue the `SELECT` statement to read the table `BLC_ORDER_ITEM`.  When transaction logic of application finished, ORM will flush 'dirty' state to database(this flush will issue the `INSERT` statement) and commit the transaction. 

In order to avoid this deadlock, we can manually flush the ORM cache (and thus the newly inserted item) to database before the execution of [updateChildOrderItem](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/order/service/workflow/AddWorkflowPriceOrderIfNecessaryActivity.java#L181). In this way, the `SELECT` statement will be reordered after the `INSERT` statement, so the deadlock is avoided.

After fixing the deadlock, we modify the broadleaf code as follows:

- [AddWorkflowPriceOrderIfNecessaryActivity.java](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/order/service/workflow/AddWorkflowPriceOrderIfNecessaryActivity.java#L178)

  ```java
  public class AddWorkflowPriceOrderIfNecessaryActivity extends BaseActivity<ProcessContext<CartOperationRequest>> {
      
      //...
      //line:69
  	@PersistenceContext(unitName="blPU")
  	protected EntityManager em;
      
      //...
  
  	public ProcessContext<CartOperationRequest> execute(ProcessContext<CartOperationRequest> context) throws Exception {
      	//...
  	    // line:178
      	em.flush()
          // We need to add the new item to the parent's child order items as well. line:179
          updateChildOrderItem(request, order); // line:180
          
          //...
          return context
  	}
      
      //...
  }
  ```
