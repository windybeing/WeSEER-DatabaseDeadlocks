# Database deadlock caused by pricing the order (1)
## 1. Overview

We firstly introduce the environment:

- Broadleaf code: Broadleafcommerce ([broadleaf-6.0.9-GA](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/tree/broadleaf-6.0.9-GA)) + Demosite ([broadleaf-6.0.9-GA](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/DemoSite/tree/broadleaf-6.0.9-GA))
- Database: MySQL 5.7.25 with **serializable** isolation level(other MySQL versions should also produce the deadlock, but we did not check)

Deadlock-related transaction:  

- [PricingService.executePricing](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/pricing/service/PricingServiceImpl.java#L37)

Deadlock-related API:

- [addCart](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework-web/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/web/controller/cart/BroadleafCartController.java#L111)



## 2. Detailed Bug Reasons 

This deadlock is caused when 2 threads simultaneously execute the [PricingService.executePricing](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/pricing/service/PricingServiceImpl.java#L37), which is a transaction responsible for pricing the order. This transaction contains 2 SQL statements as follows:

```sql
A: select * from BLC_ORDER_ITEM_DTL_ADJ where order_item_price_dtl_id = :order_item_price_dtl_id
B: insert into BLC_ORDER_ITEM_DTL_ADJ (order_item_dtl_adj_id, order_item_price_dtl_id, ...) values (:order_item_dtl_adj_id, :order_item_price_dtl_id, ...)
```

(order_item_price_dtl_id is the secondary key of table BLC_ORDER_ITEM_DTL_ADJ)

The initial state of table `BLC_ORDER_ITEM_DTL_ADJ` is as follows:

| order_item_dtl_adj_id | order_item_price_dtl_id |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1                     | 1                       |
|                       |                         |

when 2 threads simultaneously execute the transaction, we consider the following execution order: 1-A, 2-A, 1-B, 2-B

```sql
1-A: select * from BLC_ORDER_ITEM_DTL_ADJ where order_item_price_dtl_id = 2
2-A: select * from BLC_ORDER_ITEM_DTL_ADJ where order_item_price_dtl_id = 3
1-B: insert into BLC_ORDER_ITEM_DTL_ADJ (order_item_dtl_adj_id, order_item_price_dtl_id, ...) values (2, 2, ...)
2-B: insert into BLC_ORDER_ITEM_DTL_ADJ (order_item_dtl_adj_id, order_item_price_dtl_id, ...) values (3, 3, ...)
```

First, *thread-1* issues `SELECT` to find price adjustment of existing order item(whose price_dtl_id=2), but result of  `SELECT` is empty.  Because `order_item_price_dtl_id`  is indexed by table `BLC_ORDER_ITEM`'s secondary index, the *thread-1* will acquire a gap lock ranging (1， +∞)  on index `order_item_price_dtl_id`. This gap lock will block *thread-2* to insert new item into table `BLC_ORDER_ITEM_DTL_ADJ`.

First, *thread-2* issues `SELECT` to find price adjustment of existing order item(whose price_dtl_id=3), but result of  `SELECT` is empty.  Because `order_item_price_dtl_id`  is indexed by table `BLC_ORDER_ITEM`'s secondary index, the *thread-2* will acquire a gap lock ranging (1， +∞)  on index `order_item_price_dtl_id`. This gap lock will block *thread-1* to insert new item into table `BLC_ORDER_ITEM_DTL_ADJ`.

Then, *thread-1* issues `INSERT` to insert a new item with  `order_item_price_dtl_id=2` but is blocked by gap lock held by *thread-2*.

Then, *thread-2* issues `INSERT` to insert a new item with  `order_item_price_dtl_id=3` but is blocked by gap lock held by *thread-1*.

Finally, *thread-1* and *thread-2* block each other and a deadlock occurs.

## 3. Possible Solution

In order to avoid this deadlock, we propose to move the `select * from BLC_ORDER_ITEM_DTL_ADJ where order_item_price_dtl_id = :order_item_price_dtl_id` out of this transaction by issuing it ahead of the transaction [PricingService.executePricing](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/pricing/service/PricingServiceImpl.java#L37). In this way, the `select * from BLC_ORDER_ITEM_DTL_ADJ where order_item_price_dtl_id = :order_item_price_dtl_id` will not be issued again. It is because ORM caches the read results for further reads.

When this deadlock fixed, we modify the Broadleaf code as follows:

- [OrderServiceImpl.java](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/order/service/OrderServiceImpl.java#L313)

  ```java
  @Override // line:312
  public Order save(Order order, Boolean priceOrder) throws PricingException {
      //...
      if (priceOrder) { //line:326
      	//...
          // line:338
          order.getOrderItems().stream(). // added code
              flatMap(oi -> oi.getOrderItemPriceDetails().stream()). // added code
              flatMap(oipd -> oipd.getOrderItemPriceDetailAdjustments().stream()).count(); //added code
      }
      
      //...
  }
  ```

We think the deadlock fixing approach is correct because when executing [addCart](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework-web/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/web/controller/cart/BroadleafCartController.java#L111), the thread must hold the [OrderLock](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/655c3afeeb12f927a636eb43021cddee3d05133a/core/broadleaf-framework-web/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/web/order/security/CartStateFilter.java#L104) of this order. No other thread can concurrently modify the order or other rows with (direct or indirect) foreign key relationship to order, so whether the  `select * from BLC_ORDER_ITEM_DTL_ADJ where order_item_price_dtl_id = :order_item_price_dtl_id` statement is executed in or out of the transaction [PricingService.executePricing](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/blob/d4b48995dfeee46a4b227ce39783cff940254834/core/broadleaf-framework/src/main/java/org/broadleafcommerce/core/pricing/service/PricingServiceImpl.java#L37), we will get the same result.
