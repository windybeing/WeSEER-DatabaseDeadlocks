# Database deadlock caused by calculating and processing order (2)

## 1. Overview

We firstly introduce the environment:

- Shopizer code: Shopizer([shopizer-2.12.0](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/tree/2.12.0))

- Database: MySQL 5.7.25 with **serializable** isolation level(other MySQL versions should also produce the deadlock, but we did not check)

Deadlock-related transaction:  [OrderServiceImpl.caculateOrder](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/blob/3a014785e623d742b67303d8b53dcfac844051f2/sm-core/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/core/business/services/order/OrderServiceImpl.java#L217), [OrderServiceImpl.process](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/blob/3a014785e623d742b67303d8b53dcfac844051f2/sm-core/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/core/business/services/order/OrderServiceImpl.java#L128)

Precondition:

- When execute the [OrderServiceImpl.caculateOrder](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/blob/3a014785e623d742b67303d8b53dcfac844051f2/sm-core/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/core/business/services/order/OrderServiceImpl.java#L217) or [OrderServiceImpl.process](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/blob/3a014785e623d742b67303d8b53dcfac844051f2/sm-core/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/core/business/services/order/OrderServiceImpl.java#L128), there is at lease 2 items in the cart.

When a thread executes the  [OrderServiceImpl.caculateOrder](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/blob/3a014785e623d742b67303d8b53dcfac844051f2/sm-core/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/core/business/services/order/OrderServiceImpl.java#L217), it will read all products in the cart and issue multiple `SELECT` to read products from database.  When a threads executes the  [OrderServiceImpl.process](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/blob/3a014785e623d742b67303d8b53dcfac844051f2/sm-core/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/core/business/services/order/OrderServiceImpl.java#L128), it will issue multiple `UPDATE` to modify the product_availability in database.



## 2. Detail Bug Reasons 

This deadlock is caused when one thread is executing the transaction [OrderServiceImpl.caculateOrder](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/blob/3a014785e623d742b67303d8b53dcfac844051f2/sm-core/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/core/business/services/order/OrderServiceImpl.java#L217) and another thread is executeing the transaction   [OrderServiceImpl.process](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/blob/3a014785e623d742b67303d8b53dcfac844051f2/sm-core/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/core/business/services/order/OrderServiceImpl.java#L128) at the same time. 

When executing transaction [OrderServiceImpl.caculateOrder](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/blob/3a014785e623d742b67303d8b53dcfac844051f2/sm-core/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/core/business/services/order/OrderServiceImpl.java#L217), the cart has at least 2 product items. The transaction contains 2 SQL statements as follows:

```sql
A: select ... from product join product_availabilty on product.product_id=product_availabilty.product_availabity_id where product.product_id=?
B: select ... from product join product_availabilty on product.product_id=product_availabilty.product_availabity_id where product.product_id=?

```

When executing transaction  [OrderServiceImpl.process](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/blob/3a014785e623d742b67303d8b53dcfac844051f2/sm-core/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/core/business/services/order/OrderServiceImpl.java#L128), the cart has at least 2 product items. The transaction contains 2 SQL statements as follows:

```sql
C: update product_availability set ... where product_availability_id = ?
D: update product_availability set ... where product_availability_id = ?
```

When thread-1 is executing the transaction [OrderServiceImpl.caculateOrder](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/blob/3a014785e623d742b67303d8b53dcfac844051f2/sm-core/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/core/business/services/order/OrderServiceImpl.java#L217) and thread-2 is executeing the transaction   [OrderServiceImpl.process](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/blob/3a014785e623d742b67303d8b53dcfac844051f2/sm-core/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/core/business/services/order/OrderServiceImpl.java#L128) at the same time.  The cart thread-1 is operating with and the cart thread-2 is operating with both contain 2 product items(product_id=1 and product_id=2). We consider the following execution order: 1-A, 2-C, 1-B, 2-D:

```sql
1-A: select ... from product join product_availabilty on product.product_id=product_availabilty.product_availabity_id where product.product_id=1
2-C: update product_availability set ... where product_availability_id = 2
1-B: select ... from product join product_availabilty on product.product_id=product_availabilty.product_availabity_id where product.product_id=2
2-D: update product_availability set ... where product_availability_id = 1
```

(Here, we assume for the product with product_id=1, product_availability_id=1)

First, *thread-1* issues `SELECT` to read the product with `product_id=1` and it acquire a shared lock of the product with `product_id=1`.  At the same time, the `SELECT` join the table `product_availabilty` and acquire a **shared lock** of product_availabilty with `product_availability_id=1`. This shared lock will block `thread-2` to update the `product_availability` with `product_availability_id=1`. 

Then, *thread-2* issues `UPDATE` to update the `product_availabilty` with  `product_availabilty_id=2`, it acquires a **exclusive lock** of product_avalability with `product_availabilty_id=2`. This exclusive lock will block `thread-1` to read the `product_availability` with `product_availability_id=2`. 

Then, *thread-1* issues `SELECT` to read the product with `product_id=2`. At the same time, the `SELECT` join the table `product_availabilty`, so thread-1 also need to read the `product_availabilty` with  `product_availability_id=2` but it is blocked by the exclusive lock held by thread-2.

Then, *thread-2* issues `UPDATE` to update the `product_availabilty` with  `product_availabilty_id=1`, but it is blocked by the shared lock held by thread-1.

Finally, *thread-1* and *thread-2* block each other and a deadlock occurs.

## 3. Possible Solution

We find this deadlock is caused when 2 threads need access the same multiple products and at least one thread is trying to modify accessed products. The access order of products of different threads is not consistent, so the locking order is also not consistent, which may lead to a deadlock. We can ensure the same locking order of products by **sorting** them before we access these products from database. For `sku` is the unique field of `product`, we sort the product accesses accroding to `sku` of product.

Firstly, we slightly modify the `ShoppingCartItem` class to add the `sku` field. We modify [ShoppingCartItem.java](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/blob/3a014785e623d742b67303d8b53dcfac844051f2/sm-core-model/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/core/model/shoppingcart/ShoppingCartItem.java#L38) as follows:
```java

// line:38
public class ShoppingCartItem extends SalesManagerEntity<Long, ShoppingCartItem> implements Auditable, Serializable { 
    //...
    //line:90

    // Add sku field.
    private String sku;

    // Modify the constructor method to assign the sku.
    public ShoppingCartItem(ShoppingCart shoppingCart, Product product) {
		this.product = product;
		this.productId = product.getId();
		this.quantity = 1;
		this.shoppingCart = shoppingCart;
		this.sku = product.getSku(); // add this
	}
    
    // Modify the constructor method to assign the sku.
    public ShoppingCartItem(Product product) {
		this.product = product;
		this.productId = product.getId();
		this.quantity = 1;
        this.sku = product.getSku(); // add this
	}

    // Add this method to get sku from ShoppingCartItem 
    public String getSku() {
		return sku;
	}
}

```

After fixing this deadlock, [OrderServiceImpl.process](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/blob/3a014785e623d742b67303d8b53dcfac844051f2/sm-core/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/core/business/services/order/OrderServiceImpl.java#L128) look like as follows:

```java
private Order process(Order order, Customer customer, List<ShoppingCartItem> items, OrderTotalSummary summary, Payment payment, Transaction transaction, MerchantStore store) throws ServiceException {
    //...
    //Comment the line 195
    // Set<OrderProduct> products = order.getOrderProducts();
    
    // relace Set with List
    List<OrderProduct> products = new ArrayList<>(order.getOrderProducts());
    // sort products in list
    products.sort(Comparator.comparing(OrderProduct::getSku));
    
    //...
    
    return order;
}
```

After fixing this deadlock,  [OrderServiceImpl.caculateOrder](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/blob/3a014785e623d742b67303d8b53dcfac844051f2/sm-core/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/core/business/services/order/OrderServiceImpl.java#L217) look like as follows:

```java
private OrderTotalSummary caculateOrder(OrderSummary summary, Customer customer, final MerchantStore store, final Language language) throws Exception {
    //...
    //line:235
    List<ShoppingCartItem> items = summary.getProducts();
    items.sort(Comparator.comparing(ShoppingCartItem::getSku));
    for(ShoppingCartItem item : items) {
    
    //...
    
    return totalSummary;
}
```
