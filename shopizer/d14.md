# Database deadlock caused by calculating order

## 1. Overview

We firstly introduce the environment:

- Shopizer code: Shopizer([shopizer-2.12.0](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/tree/2.12.0))

- Database: MySQL 5.7.25 with **serializable** isolation level(other MySQL versions should also produce the deadlock, but we did not check)

Deadlock-related transaction:  [OrderServiceImpl.caculateOrder](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/blob/3a014785e623d742b67303d8b53dcfac844051f2/sm-core/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/core/business/services/order/OrderServiceImpl.java#L217)

Deadlock-related API: [Ship](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/blob/3a014785e623d742b67303d8b53dcfac844051f2/sm-shop/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/shop/store/controller/order/ShoppingOrderController.java#L977), [CommitOrder](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/blob/3a014785e623d742b67303d8b53dcfac844051f2/sm-shop/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/shop/store/controller/order/ShoppingOrderController.java#L659)

When a customer submits delivery address form, a **Ship API request** will be sent to shopizer's web server. And when a customer commits the order, a **CommitOrder API** request will be sent to the server. Both Ship API and CommitOrder API will invoke the  [OrderServiceImpl.caculateOrder](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/blob/3a014785e623d742b67303d8b53dcfac844051f2/sm-core/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/core/business/services/order/OrderServiceImpl.java#L217), which is a transaction to calculate the total price of the order. During the execution of  [OrderServiceImpl.caculateOrder](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/blob/3a014785e623d742b67303d8b53dcfac844051f2/sm-core/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/core/business/services/order/OrderServiceImpl.java#L217), it will first issue `SELECT`  to read product in this order from database, then it may reset product's availability and issue `UPDATE` to update the product data in database when transaction commits. 

If there are 2 threads executing the  [OrderServiceImpl.caculateOrder](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/blob/3a014785e623d742b67303d8b53dcfac844051f2/sm-core/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/core/business/services/order/OrderServiceImpl.java#L217) at the same time, it may lead to a deadlock.


## 2. Detail Bug Reasons 

This deadlock is caused when 2 threads simultaneously execute the transaction [OrderServiceImpl.caculateOrder](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/blob/3a014785e623d742b67303d8b53dcfac844051f2/sm-core/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/core/business/services/order/OrderServiceImpl.java#L217) This transaction contains 2 SQL statements as follows:

```sql
A: select ... from product join ... where product_id = xxx
B: update product set ... where prodcut_id = xxx
```

When 2 threads simultaneously execute the transaction. The *thread-1* handles the Ship or CommitOrder API request from customer-1, and *thread-2* handles the Ship or CommitOrder API request from customer-2. The orders of customer-1 and customer-2 both contain a product(product_id=1). We consider the following execution order: 1-A, 2-A, 1-B, 2-B

```sql
1-A: select ... from product join ... where product_id = 1
2-A: select ... from product join ... where product_id = 1
1-B: update product set ... where prodcut_id = 1
2-B: update product set ... where prodcut_id = 1
```

First, *thread-1* issues `SELECT` to read the product with `product_id=1` and it acquire a **shared lock** of the product with id=1.  This shared lock will block *thread-2* to update the product with id=1. 

Then, *thread-2* issues `SELECT` to read the product with `product_id=1` and it acquire a **shared lock** of the product with id=1.  This shared lock will block *thread-1* to update the product with id=1. 

Then, *thread-1* issues `UPDATE` to update the product with  `product_id=1` but is blocked by shared lock held by *thread-2*.

Then, *thread-2* issues `UPDATE` to update the product with  `product_id=1` but is blocked by shared lock held by *thread-1*.

Finally, *thread-1* and *thread-2* block each other and a deadlock occurs.



## 3. Possible Solution

We find this deadlock is caused when 2 threads try to read and modify the same product at the same time. We fix this deadlock with application-level lock. **We maintain a lock for each product**,  and when executing  [OrderServiceImpl.caculateOrder](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/blob/3a014785e623d742b67303d8b53dcfac844051f2/sm-core/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/core/business/services/order/OrderServiceImpl.java#L217), a thread need to acquire the lock before read the product. For `sku` is the unique field of `product`, we lock the product accroding to `sku`.

Firstly, we slightly modify the `ShoppingCartItem` class to add the `sku` field. We modify [ShoppingCartItem.java](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/blob/3a014785e623d742b67303d8b53dcfac844051f2/sm-core-model/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/core/model/shoppingcart/ShoppingCartItem.java#L38) as follows:
```java

// line:38
public class ShoppingCartItem extends SalesManagerEntity<Long, ShoppingCartItem> implements Auditable, Serializable { 
    //...
    //line:90

    // Add sku field.
    private String sku;

    // Modify the constructor method to assign the sku.
    public ShoppingCartItem(ShoppingCart shoppingCart, Product product) {
		this.product = product;
		this.productId = product.getId();
		this.quantity = 1;
		this.shoppingCart = shoppingCart;
		this.sku = product.getSku(); // add this
	}
    
    // Modify the constructor method to assign the sku.
    public ShoppingCartItem(Product product) {
		this.product = product;
		this.productId = product.getId();
		this.quantity = 1;
        this.sku = product.getSku(); // add this
	}

    // Add this method to get sku from ShoppingCartItem 
    public String getSku() {
		return sku;
	}
}

```

After fixing this deadlock,  [OrderServiceImpl.caculateOrder](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/blob/3a014785e623d742b67303d8b53dcfac844051f2/sm-core/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/core/business/services/order/OrderServiceImpl.java#L217) look like as follows:

```java
private OrderTotalSummary caculateOrder(OrderSummary summary, Customer customer, final MerchantStore store, final Language language) throws Exception {
    //...
    //line:274
    
    //Before accessing the products, should acquire the lock of products in the order.
    List<ShoppingCartItem> items = summary.getProducts();
    List<String> skus = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < items.size(); i++) {
        skus.add(items.get(i).getSku());
    }
    putLocks(skus);
    
    // read products, line:285
    OrderTotalVariation orderTotalVariation = orderTotalService.findOrderTotalVariation(summary, customer, store, language);
   
    // ...
    //line:395
    
    // flush to ensure the UPDATE is issued before the function return.
    this.flush();
    // Release the lock of products.
    removeLocks(skus);
}

```



We add a field called `lockMap` in `OrderServiceImpl` to support locking/unlocking products according to `sku`, which is unique for each product. We also add `putLocks`, `putLock`, and `removeLocks`, `removeLock` methods to operate with `lockMap`.

```java
class OrderServiceImpl {   
    
  /**
   * Map of locks for given product sku. This lock map ensures that only a single request can handle a particular order
   * at a time
   */
    protected static ConcurrentMap<String, Object> lockMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
    
   /**
   * Get an object to lock on for the given product sku
   *
   * @param sku
   * @return null if there was not already a lock object available. If an object was already in the map, this will return
   * that object.
   */
    protected Object putLock(String sku) {
        return lockMap.putIfAbsent(sku, new Object());
    }
    
    /**
    * Acquire locks for a list of product.
    */
    protected void putLocks(List<String> skus) {
        try {
        for (String sku : skus) {
            while (putLock(sku) != null) {
            }
        }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            assert false;
        }
    }
    
    /**
    * Done with processing the given sku, remove the lock from the map
    *
    * @param sku
    */
    protected void removeLock(String sku) {
        lockMap.remove(sku);
    }

    protected void removeLocks(List<String> skus) {
        for (String sku : skus) {
            removeLock(sku);
        }
    }
}
```
